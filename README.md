# IOT-MQTT-PROJECT
IoT using MQTT broker
I have generated random values for three parameters which are temperature, pressure and humidity (in the given range) for input from sensors. Upon comparing these input values with the fixed set points further process can be done by the system. Also, based on results from the comparision, alert messages are generated upon alarmic levels of input.
